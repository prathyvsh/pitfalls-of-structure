* Pitfalls of Structure

Structures are thought of as great things to create artificial boundaries to make the containment terrain tractable for various operations.
While structures are advocated as a means for probing a previously unknown territory, it is not without it’s pitfalls.

** Big picture ideas

*** Hard to rearrange once you build up
Modularity may help here, but only to a point

*** Opacity
Creating a structure means that you won’t be able to see through to the other side once a barrier (which is not a barrier in the absolute context but a means towards building up the bigger structure), is raised.

** Finer details from technologies

*** HTML

**** Having a retained DOM layoutting system means that layout reflows of properties that change this layout are hard hitting on the graphics card processing.
